  pushing stack usage into the expression...

  this is wrong - it should be the maximum stack use needed to evaluate the 
  expression.

  Whatâ€™s happening here is that the Idris standard library defines plus on Nat
  in such a way that the Idris compiler can easily see that 1 + n is equal to S
  n, but cannot easily see this about n + 1:


  OK - we can actually do lambdas... with stack machine... which is very interesting.
  if we have a complicated lambda expression.... then the bound arguments...

  (\x . 1 + 3 + x) (x)

  the argument is in the wrong stack place - or is it...
  code would be, push 1, push 3, add, add

  (\x . x + 1 + 3) (x)

  push 1, add, push 3, add

  ----
  to call 
    - push current location, so we cant jump back.
    - push args.

-}

-- ok, I thnink we need a rewrite? 

{-
  - hang on - if we have the expression - then we can just calculate the stack usage...
  we don't have to push it into the types...
  and we're never really going to know - what the max is - anyway - when we have map/fold on unknown lists? 

  evaluation...
