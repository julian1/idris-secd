instructions can be executable and not just symbolic. This is probably required to encode the effect of the VM 
eg.
then we have types encoding effects on the vm 

run : Vm -> Insn -> Vm



And we can use g.f like composition for instructions. we don't need to treat them as a list.

AND - if we use a type - then we can pattern match - to restructure. if we want.

But also OpCodes can be separate from the Insn function. eg. can model like this,

Vm -> Insn Op -> Vm 
plus vm (Insn "ADD" ) = ...
